Southeast Asian refugees and immigrants in the U.S. have built vibrant neighborhoods filled with interdependence and creativity–despite ongoing deportations and targeting from the government. There is more to our story than surviving war and imperialism. The cultural library offers a glimpse into the wisdom of our communities. Among the resources you’ll find are academic articles about domestic violence, poetry, dance footage, LGBTQ dictionaries, and more. 

This Cultural Library was generated to:

Purpose: A digital media archive that tells the story of Southeast Asians in the the United States, in order to increase visibility, educate the public, and shift the political landscape of our communities.

Audience: Students, educators, community organizers, advocates, caregivers

Message: Southeast Asian history is more complex than the war. Refugees have demonstrated resilience and created networks of care despite government neglect. Southeast Asian history illustrates the connection between the imperialist violence machine and climate catastrophe, therefore Southeast Asians hold the wisdom to assist in creating a better world for all people and our planet. Refugee resettlement was a failure.

Engagement: Assets are shared on social media, and spread via influencers. Creating content through connecting with relevant influencers and having them highlight their contributions to the library. 

Measures of success: 1000 page views at the end of 2023. 4 influencer activations. 3 organizational partnerships.
