It is a book that weaves the personal with the cultural, love with loss, and dancing with poetry. The poems express an element of what Lao America can be. Krysada writes about his identity through experiences over time. He writes to show such experiences through poetic technique; rather than a literal re-telling of his narrative. Split into four sections: 'Southeast', 'City of Fog', 'Mekong', and 'The Theater', each part reveals a way in which Krysada shares a piece of his mind to the world in an effort to exist in spaces not previously welcomed.
