MA is a comic book based on the true story of how Huynh’s family came to Australia. A young couple are forced to flee their homeland as the Vietnam War escalates. They wait in Malaysia’s Pulau Bidong refugee camps in a perpetual state of purgatory as they wait to seek asylum, whilst treasuring pockets of silliness and romance as they learn to raise two boys and await news from home and of their uncertain future.
